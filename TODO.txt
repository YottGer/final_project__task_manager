Client:
- Styling
- Validation (if needed)
- Implement redux-toolkit for light/dark theme toggle

Server:
- validation

DB:
- create tagId <-> tagString table and save tagIds in the task record instead of text[]
- read about the text[] in postgreSQL and check wether it is easy to access it in native SQL. if not, change to link table
- make sure no repeated strings are stored in the db. for example - change the "status" column of a project from text
  to integer, refrencing the id of a row in a table with two columns - statusId, statusText.

Other:
- Manage packages
- Change path names to include - instead of _ (?)
- Catch all errors
- Make the entire code prettier
